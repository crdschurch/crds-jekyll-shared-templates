<h2 class="font-family-condensed-extra text-uppercase"><strong style="line-height: 1.425;">Questions
        and Answers</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p><b>Will there be alcohol at this event?</b></p>
<p><span>Yes. While it is certainly not the focus, alcohol will be present.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How much is it?<br></b><span style="line-height: 1.625;">MAN CAMP is $59.99.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.625;"><strong>How old do I need to be to attend MAN CAMP?<br></strong></span>The
    minimum age for MAN CAMP is 18. We know there are lots of 15 year old men (and 40 year old boys),
    but the law of our state says you're an adult at 18 (and MAN CAMP is an adults only adventure).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="line-height: 1.425;">What if I’ve never camped before?<br></strong>No
    problem. This trip is all about getting outside your comfort zone, alongside other men. We’re here
    to challenge you and encourage you, whether you’ve camped for decades or don’t own a tent. When we
    trade convenience, comfort and security for the great unknown, we’re pretty much guaranteed to
    grow.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What if I don’t know anybody?<br></strong>Perfect! You’ll make
    friends in no time. Every man camper will be assigned a unit: a group of 9 other guys, led by a
    trip captain. You’ll do everything with your unit: get outfitted, bring food, set up camp, compete
    and generally solve problems. You are going to be good friends with your unit by the time this trip
    is over.</p>
<div></div>
<p><strong>What if I don't go to Crossroads?<br></strong>Cool! You'll still love it. Tons of other guys
    who don't call Crossroads home will be there. MAN CAMP is powered by Crossroads but the movement is
    way bigger than that.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What do I need to bring?<br></strong>Once you’re signed up,
    we’ll send you a full list. But the short version is: one duffel bag and one backpack, filled with
    camping gear, a chair, dry clothes and food.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">How long is it?<br></strong><span>From&nbsp;</span><span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1861937284"
        tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">Friday</span></span><span>&nbsp;evening
        to around&nbsp;</span><span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1861937291" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">1pm</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span
        class="aBn" data-term="goog_1861937292" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">on Sunday</span></span><span>&nbsp;afternoon.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div><b>What time do I need to be there&nbsp;<span class="aBn" data-term="goog_2064217424" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">on
                Friday</span></span>?</b></div>
<div><span>Ingress will be available from 1600-1830. If you arrive early you'll be directed to a
        staging area until 1600.&nbsp; As long as you are inside the gate by 1830, you're good.&nbsp;</span><span>Your
        entire Unit must be present to begin the hike in.</span></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What if I have to leave early?<br></strong><span>You’re in for
        the whole deal if you go. The entire event is a communal experience.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What if it rains?<br></strong>Then we’ll probably get wet.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What if it snows?<br></strong>Snow is a lot like rain, but
    colder.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What are we doing?<br></strong>Sleeping outside. Building fires.
    Roasting pigs. Laughing. Competing. Splitting wood. Drinking malted beverages (if we’re old
    enough). BYOing pretty much everything. Testing our strength. Telling stories. Making pals. Talking
    to God. Doing life together.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">Why do tickets go on sale so early in the morning?<br></strong>See
    above re: getting outside your comfort zone.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">Is this event tax-deductible?<br></strong>Sorry, no.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">Can I buy a block of tickets for my buddies?<br></strong>Nope.
    Each man needs to commit (because that’s what men do) to this and reserve their own spot. Plus,
    everybody has to sign the waiver electronically. Do you trust your buddy to sign your life away?
    (Just saying.)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What if I sign up, and then cancel at the last minute?<br></strong>Tickets
    are non-refundable. If you cancel, we’ll give your spot to someone on the waiting list.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What if there’s an emergency at home while I’m gone?<br></strong>We’ll
    have a way for your family to reach you (and you them) if there’s an emergency. And by emergency we
    don’t mean the cable goes out or Buster wins his football game.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What if I can’t sleep without a CPAP?<br></strong>Can’t is a
    pretty strong statement. We know that is a reality for a few of us. We don’t have any electricity
    available and portable CPAP options are crazy expensive. We have had men <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B004EIAADG/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_n5T-AbZQ0NERT">use
        this portable battery pack to power their units</a> and it has worked well for the entire
    weekend. They recommend turning off any extra features on your machine to conserve the battery. If
    you truly cannot sleep without a CPAP, and you can’t justify buying a battery pack, MAN CAMP
    probably isn’t a good choice for you.</p>
