            <p class="lead">An adventure for men who seek justice for the oppressed. This is an inaugural GO Nepal Trip, where a group of men will be trekking in the Himalayas and supporting our new partner in Nepal. This organization works in rural village communities that suffer from poverty and exploitation, where many girls fall victim to human trafficking. We will support their work, which enables these villages to achieve a better future and transform the region. The community projects vary based on the needs of the villages at the time. In the past teams have helped build fish farms, taught english classes, and supported local businesses. This trip will support the ultimate mission to eliminate human trafficking in these highly vulnerable areas.</p>
