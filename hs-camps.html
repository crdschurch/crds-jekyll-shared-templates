<li>Students who live in the greater Lexington area will be dropped off at Crossroads Georgetown early at 6:30am Saturday morning and picked up at the same location between 12-1pm on Sunday.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Where is Camp? </strong></p>
<ul><li>At Crossroads Base Camp! 435 acres in Neville, Ohio. Rolling hills, small ponds, gorgeous views.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>How much does it cost?</strong><span> </span></p>
<ul><li>The cost of camp is $75. This includes transportation to and from Base Camp and dinner on Saturday. Campers will need to acquire all other gear and food for Camp.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>How do I register? </strong></p>
<ul><li>Sign up for <a href="http://www.crossroads.net/camps/4569742/family" target="_blank">HS Girl Camp here</a> and <a href="http://www.crossroads.net/camps/4569743/family" target="_blank">HS Guy Camp here</a>. Payment is required at the time of registration to reserve a spot.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Are camp fees refundable?</strong><span> </span></p>
<ul><li>Camp fees are NOT refundable and are NOT tax deductible.  </li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Is there flexibility to come and go? Can I be late?</strong></p>
<ul><li>No. Once we’re at camp, we’re there to stay—unless there’s some unforeseen emergency. And no leaving early, because it disrupts the experience for you and others.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Can students drive themselves to camp? </strong></p>
<ul><li>No. All students will meet at the designated site for check-in and will ride buses to camp. Students will not be permitted to drive themselves to camp.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>My student takes medicine or has allergies. How is that handled? </strong></p>
<ul><li>You’ll have the opportunity to provide information about medication and allergies when you sign your student up for Camp. Students will plan camp meals with their group and leader, giving them the opportunity to plan for food allergies or special requirements. Students will be responsible for taking their own medication. We ask that students only bring enough medicine for the duration of camp. All medication should be brought to camp in original prescription bottles. An adult leader will MONITOR student’s taking of any medications. Monitor means that the volunteer will provide an opportunity for the student to take the medication as close to the scheduled time as possible and observe the student taking the medication, to the best of their ability. Neither the leader nor Crossroads may be held liable for the failure of the student to take the medication as prescribed.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Who are the adults at HS Guy/Girl Camp?</strong><span> </span></p>
<ul><li>Crossroads adult leaders. ONLY female leaders will be at HS Girl Camp and ONLY male leaders will be at HS Guy Camp. Background checks, interviews and training sessions are required for all leaders.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>What is the ratio of adult leaders to student campers? </strong></p>
<ul><li>Approximately one leader for every 7 students.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>What will they eat at camp? </strong></p>
<ul><li>Students will plan camp meals with their group and leader. We will provide a campfire dinner meal on Saturday night.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Where will students sleep at camp?</strong><span> </span></p>
<ul><li>It’s primal camping so students will sleep in tents. Students will be grouped with an adult leader and other students from the Crossroads site where they attend.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Seriously, do participants really have to sleep in a tent? </strong></p>
<ul><li>Yep, truly. We’ll all be in tents. Kinda awesome, right?</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>What if we don’t have a tent? </strong></p>
<ul><li>Fear not! After group assignments, that’ll get figured out. Leaders will help facilitate sharing, borrowing and figuring out solutions. Have a tent but no know-how? No worries. We'll figure it out together. Click <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1viZgpVWFqXn6VSCxkZ4qSeLdK52Quriq" target="_blank">HERE</a> for the full packing list.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Will there be restroom facilities?</strong><span> </span></p>
<ul><li>Yes! We’ll have port-a-lets, because, while we’re keen to camp, let’s be honest—some stuff just isn’t worth the fight. But there’s also plenty of woods, and we encourage bravery.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Is it true? No cell phones?!</strong></p>
<ul><li>The word on the street is true.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Can students bring knives?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Nope. Click <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1viZgpVWFqXn6VSCxkZ4qSeLdK52Quriq" target="_blank">HERE</a> for the full list of what to bring and NOT to bring to camp.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>My student wants to be in a campsite group with a student who attends another Crossroads site. Is that OK? </strong></p>
<ul><li>We encourage students to be grouped with others from their site. This is a great way to deepen relationships with leaders and students they’ll see each week in HS. If your student still wants to be grouped with someone from another site, they will be assigned to that site if space is available.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>A hike? I’m concerned about fitness levels.</strong></p>
<ul><li>Buses will unload about one mile from where we camp, so students will walk in with their gear. It's rolling hills and a dirt road. We have no doubts that your student can absolutely crush it. However, if there are serious physical limitations, consider waiting until a future camp.  </li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Have a health or physical issue?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Email <a href="mailto:studentministry@crossroads.net">studentministry@crossroads.net</a>. We’ll do everything we can to make it work. But there are certain limitations—like not having electricity at the campsites or onsite refrigeration—that might make this event too challenging for those needs. Use your best discretion.</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>What if there’s an emergency?</strong></p>
<ul><li>We’ll have an emergency phone number and a communications system in place. It’ll be OK.</li>
</ul><p class="quiet"><strong>What if it rains? Or snows?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Being in nature is an adventure. You don’t get to only choose the good times. If it gets a little damp or cold, we’ll lean in and make the best of it.</li>
</ul><p class="quiet"><strong><strong>More questions?</strong><br></strong></p>
<ul><li>Email <a href="mailto:studentministry@crossroads.net">studentministry@crossroads.net</a> OR wait until you get assigned a leader. Thanks!</li>
