<h3>Key points</h3>
<p>Working from rest is the only way to bear fruit. In fact, it's the first this we did after God created us.</p>
<p>Starting new things take <strong>discipline</strong>. But over time, that discipline becomes a <strong>habit</strong>, and eventually part of your <strong>lifestyle</strong>.</p>
