<h4>What’s a Journey</h4>
<p>The Journey is a six-week self-discovery process. Thousands of people (kids and adults) come together to focus on a topic to kick-start spiritual growth.</p>
<p>It’s comprised of three components:</p>
<ul><li>the weekend message</li>
<li>individual challenges in the app</li>
<li>group discussion</li>
</ul><p>All of these work together to make the journey one of the most transformational things we do.</p>
