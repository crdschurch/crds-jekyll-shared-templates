                    up with other college students and our partner, Amigos for Christ, and dig into the fantastic
                    community-reviving work that’s happening here. You’ll do anything from wield a shovel to install a
                    flushing toilet—village improvements that make a substantial, daily impact on health and home.
                    After a morning coffee, you hit the dirt and worksite, building relationships with Nicaraguans as
                    much as each other. In the evenings, it’s wind down with a good communal meal, some conversation,
                    some song. There might even be a volcano climb thrown in for good measure. So, put those college
                    days on pause and try something far outside the norm. Good stories are inevitable.</p>
                  <p class="lead"><span>Since April of 2018, the country of Nicaragua has experienced extensive
                      political unrest, including a period of violent protests. Thankfully, over the past six months,
                      violence has significantly decreased. The majority of recent conflict has been seen at political
                      rallies in a few main cities. You may be asking, so is it even safe to go to Nicaragua?
                      Crossroads relies heavily on information and guidance from our partners that are living and
                      working there each and every day. They have communicated that roads have been clear and no
                      violence has been seen where they are located in over six months. They are able to work and live
                      like they had before the unrest started and are ready to host groups in 2019. Rest assured that
                      Crossroads would never send people to a location that we felt was unsafe, and we will not let
                      fear guide our decisions. We are excited to get back to helping our partners Amigos for Christ.</span></p>

                      risk and we don’t take that likely. Because of the recent political unrest in Nicaragua, the
                      United States government has Nicaragua listed as a travel advisory three. With this information,
                      we rely heavily on the partners who are living and working in Nicaragua every day to guide us and
                      to provide us with accurate information. They have told us that roads have been clear and no

                    program that facilitates clean water getting into village homes, oral and physical health,
                    community education, and economic development in rural Nicaraguan communities. We jump into work
                    with Amigos every time we’re on Nicaraguan soil, because we trust and respect the way they’re
                    revitalizing villages in simple but powerful ways.</p>
