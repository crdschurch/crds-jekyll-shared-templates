  <h2 class="flush-top">Get some People</h2>
  <p>This week, we're tackling one of the biggest questions we run across when starting or growing groups. Who the heck am I going to invite? And where am I going to find them?</p>

  <h3>Key Points</h3>
  <p>Look for People of Peace. People who:</p>
  <ul><li>Like you</li>
  <li>Welcome you</li>
  <li>Serve you</li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
  <h3>Try It Out</h3>
  <p>Take some time to take stock of the people in your life. Think of neighbors, coworkers, that guy at the gym who always wants to talk in the locker room. Who is God already bringing to you? Spend a few days in this posture.</p>
  <p>Then, be bold and try inviting them to something. Like Rachel said, dinners are amazing. It doesn't have to be huge, just find a way to open your life to those people and see how God shows up.</p>
  <p>This takes time. Your Coach will check on you and see what progress you’re making. If you have questions or need help, reach out to them.&nbsp;</p>
