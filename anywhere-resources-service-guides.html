<h3 class="flush-bottom component-header">THRIVE: Week 2</h3>
<p>August 8, 2017<br />
Brian Tome is teaching this weekend about Forgiveness, Honor, and Trust!&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="flush-bottom component-header">THRIVE: WEEK 1</h3>
<p>August 31, 2017<br />
Chuck Mingo kicks off our new series THRIVE with 2 important principles - Follow Well and Celebrate. We all want the good life. Rewarding relationships, a flourishing business, and a family that actually likes spending time together. We know that the good life is more than wealth, riches, success, or power. We crave those moments in life when things just “work.” Yet those good moments are all too temporary, and we find ourselves right back in the grind. God designed us for a vibrant, thriving life, but the path to get there never shows up on Facebook lists or self-help books. Join us every week in this series for more ways to THRIVE.

<p>August 25, 2017</p>
<div>
<div>Brian Tome is talking this weekend about Jesus as the Life! He'll also draw parallels to the awesome eclipse that happened this week.&nbsp;Head's up, communion is happening this weekend! We want to create the option for folks to participate in communion by having something to eat and something to drink ready to go. It doesn't have to be bread and wine, it could be anything! At the end of service, we'll have the chance to do this and remember Jesus' sacrifice together.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<hr><h3 class="flush-bottom component-header">How Can We Know The Way?: Week 2</h3>
<p>August 18, 2017</p>
<div>
<div>This weekend we are hearing from Chuck Mingo about Jesus as the Truth and how His authority in our lives matters. We are going to have a time at the end of service to confess something that we have been putting in priority over God. Chuck will ask you to write that thing down on a piece of paper or as a note on your phone. Then he will tell you, no matter what that thing is you're forgiven - Jesus is your Authority!</div>

<div>One way you can prepare for this, is to have pieces of paper, pens, and a trash can nearby! Remember, not everyone will want to participate, but for those who do, it will be a powerful moment.</div>
</div>
<hr><h3 class="flush-bottom component-header">How Can We Know The Way?: Week 1</h3>
<p>August 11, 2017</p>
<div>This weekend we are starting a new series called How Can We Know The Way? That seems like a pretty big question. How do we know we are making the right decisions? Well this weekend Brian Tome is unpacking how Jesus is They Way. The fall is a great time to invite people to try out Crossroads. People are getting back into a rhythm and are open to trying something new. Consider who you could share a video with or have a conversation with. If you ever have any questions, just email us at <a href="mailto:anywhere@crossroads.net">anywhere@crossroads.net</a>.</div>

<hr><h3 class="flush-bottom component-header">Spark 2017: Week 4</h3>
<p>July 7, 2017</p>
<div>
<div>This weekend is week 4 of Spark, new ideas to ignite your life! This week we are hearing from our very own Matt Welty and Jamie Simms. Jamie leads the Crossroads community in Columbus and she is talking about her experience "grieving the loss of my comfortable life". Matt, the campus pastor of Crossroads Anywhere is talking about "Let's start a movement".&nbsp;</div>

<div>This weekend we are having communion at the end of service. To make your gathering a success, grab something to drink and something to eat. When prompted, use that to take communion. You can just leave it an open place, on a coffee table, and let people do it if they choose! We don't want to make folks uncomfortable by assuming that everyone is following God and wanting to participate in this moment.</div>

<h3 class="flush-bottom component-header">Fear is a Liar: Week 1</h3>
<p>May 19, 2017</p>
<p>
This week we are starting our new series, Fear is a Liar. Fear, it’s that barrier you just can’t get around. That conflict you just can’t resolve. That problem that just won’t go away. And deep down, you’re afraid that this is just how things are going to be. But - we are designed for more. God never meant for us to live trapped by fear, anxiety, and limitations. Breakthrough is not only possible, it’s what God wants to give you.We are hearing from our Senior pastor Brian Tome this week and he has a special message just for Crossroads Anywhere.</p>
