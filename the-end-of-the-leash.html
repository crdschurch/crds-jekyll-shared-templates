            <p class="lead">The first time I admitted how mangled up I felt in my identity, I was 28 years old and in a meeting with my boss who was
            asking me to get together with a group of women. I was working at a church, so that request sounds pretty simple, right?
            Nope.</p>
            <p class="font-size-base">I looked at him and said, “Those women won’t want to meet with me. What do I have to offer them? Nope, not going to do
            it.” He looked me in the eye and asked, “Why?” And not just a simple “why”—he wanted me to explain the real-deal,
            heart-in-your-throat why. I tried to dodge it and list the obvious stuff that I assumed anyone could see. Those women
            were all pretty, well dressed, like REAL ladies. They had money. They had their stuff together. What did I have to
            offer? Just to be clear, I didn’t know these ladies very well. They’d all been super kind to me whenever we interacted,
            but I made judgments about them based on some rules I had formed in my head about myself and other women from way
            earlier in life. Being with groups of women was my own personal hell.</p>
            <p class="font-size-base">Apparently my first round of answers weren’t good enough, so my boss kept pushing. I didn’t want to go deeper because it
            meant I would have to admit who I really believed I was. I was a fraud. I loved Jesus, but there was this other stuff
            that I didn’t want to let him know. If he knew, surely he’d be as appalled as I was by it all. Finally, I told him
            anyway.</p>
            <p class="font-size-base crds-list">
                <strong>Here’s the list I gave him:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>I was in the psych ward in high school because I attempted suicide three times—so I was emotionally unstable (at least
                    that’s what I thought about myself).</li>
                    <li>I could have wrote a biography called “The Road to Hoedom” describing my life before marriage.</li>
                    <li>I didn’t finish college.</li>
                    <li>I got married at 20 and had my first kid before 21.</li>
                    <li>I was always broke and didn’t see that ever changing.</li>
                    <li>I NEVER fit in with women. I wanted to wear gym shoes and workout clothes all the time and I didn’t understand the small
                    talk.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p class="font-size-base">The list could go on and on. It was super uncomfortable admitting all of this to him, but then he just looked at me—like
            really looked at me in a way that made me feel unable to hide—and he challenged me. He reminded me who God says I am: I
            am a daughter of God, created in His image, 100% forgiven and 100% loved. My list of shame wasn’t my identity, it is
            just part of my story and the beliefs I built up because of my brokeness.</p>
            <p class="font-size-base">I was letting this list leash me to a lie. The lie was that my identity was the sum of all my failures, rather than who
            God says I am. <strong>I had been missing out on experiencing God’s redemptive power in all these things because I wrapped them
            around my neck like a collar, and attached it to a short leash.</strong> I could only go so far, do so much, say so much...before
            the leash pulled me back to my reality of who I believed I was: a failure, a slut, uneducated, financially needy, and an
            emotionally unstable woman..</p>
            <p class="font-size-base">You know what happened next? My boss asked me to write down my story, of all the things I identified myself as, and then
            I had to read it out loud to a group of people who loved me. I read it, cried, wept, felt ashamed, and then I burned
            that letter. As soon as I burned it those people who loved me began telling me who I really was. They spoke words over
            me about my identity in Christ. They told me how they received me and the strengths and giftings they see in me. It was
            a life changing moment. <strong>When I burned that paper of all my “failures and brokenness,” it was like God was helping me
            unhook the leash I had around my neck.</strong> And when my community spoke truth and encouragement over me, I knew I was being
            unleashed. Not just unhooked, but unleashed—like propelling me, a broken but beautiful daughter, into the world with my
            true identity.</p>
            <p class="font-size-base">Fast forward 16 years (there are lots of other God moments and growth in there, but this is a blog post, not a book), my
            current day job is building into groups of women. God has brought me full circle. Me—that same woman with the list of
            all the reasons why I didn’t measure up, the one who said my personal hell was to be in groups of women, the one who
            walked in shame because of all my failures—spends my days pursuing “unleashing” moments for other women. God has
            redeemed all of it. Every single thing I wrote on that paper and burned, He has redeemed.</p>
