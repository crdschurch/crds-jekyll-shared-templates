<p class="flush-bottom">We’ve learned alongside people who have started Crossroads Anywhere communities over the past couple of years. Here are some of the most common questions from the Anywhere community and answers from Anywhere community experts.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>How do I get people to come to my Crossroads Anywhere gathering?</strong><br>Invite, invite, invite. For the 20+ years of Crossroads history, we’ve grown because Crossroads people introduce new people to Crossroads. Invite your family, friends, neighbors, and that person you always see at the grocery store to be a part of what you’re doing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>How do I advertise my Crossroads Anywhere community?</strong> <br>Your invitation is going to be more powerful than any ad Crossroads creates. A Crossroads yard sign doesn’t mean much to someone who has never heard of Crossroads. But we live in a culture where most people have a gazillion followers on the internet and very few meaningful relationships. You’re asking if people want to go beyond the surface level. Let them know that you’ve found something that challenges and encourages you every week, and invite them to watch with you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>I asked a bunch of people if they wanted to watch service with me, and they all said no. What do I do now?</strong> <br>Way to be bold. It’s frustrating when people don’t respond the way we want them to, but don’t give up yet. Sometimes changing the invitation helps. Try something like having a potluck dinner or a pancake breakfast at the same time you would usually watch service. No agenda, just time for people to get to know each other. Then invite them back same time, same place next week to watch service.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>How do I make worship feel less awkward without a band and a million LED lights?</strong> <br>You get to set the tone–it’s your home so you’re in charge. If you stand and sing, so will they. If you sit quietly and hope no one notices, they’ll do that, too. And best way to get comfortable with worshiping in your home is to get some reps in during the week. Using music to connect with God on your own will start to feel natural, and it will be easier to connect with him when others are around. And always remember that volume is your friend.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Our internet is crappy. Is there a way for us to avoid so much buffering?</strong><br>Yes and no. Live video is incredibly demanding on internet connections. If yours is flaky, we’d recommend watching service a week behind on Youtube. Youtube uses way WAY less bandwidth and plays nicer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Service is over. Now what?</strong><br>It’s totally your call. The key is to set expectations before you get started. People won’t say it, but they love knowing when something is over. If after service you want to do coffee (or beer), that’s great! Just state the end time clearly up front. It honors their time and yours.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>My home is really small. Are there other places you would recommend for my community to gather?</strong><br>Good things happen when you open your home and invite people in, no matter how small it is. We’ve seen communities start in both 500 square foot apartments and gigantic mansions. And meeting in a rented facility isn’t a golden ticket. Whatever space you have is enough.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Our gathering is getting too big for my house. What should I do?</strong><br>That’s an awesome problem to have! We’d love to walk you through next steps for you community. Email <a href="mailto:anywhere@crossroads.net">anywhere@crossroads.net</a>, and we’ll set up a time to talk.</p>
