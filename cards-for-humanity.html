<h2 class="text-center">Welcome to Cards FOR Humanity</h2>
<p class="lead text-center push-bottom">A game where you tell each other who you think they are!<br>First things first, you need to <a href="/cardsforhumanity/download-cards-for-humanity/"><strong>download the game</strong></a>, print it out on card stock (if you have it), and cut out the cards.</p>
<hr><p class="small-heading text-center">Here's how to play:</p>
<div class="row push-top push-bottom soft-ends iam-journey">
<div class="col-md-12 push-bottom">
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Each person in the group gets two I Am cards and writes their name in the first blank on each card. <br>[Cards should read “I Am insert name and I Am _______.]</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Each person in the group gets ten random phrase cards. The remaining phrase cards should be stacked in a pile in the center of the table.</p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>The first player is the player who most recently ate something (this could come down to the second if there are snacks in the room). Let’s call him Gerald.</p>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Gerald places one of his I Am cards on the table face up and reads the card out loud: “I Am Gerald and I Am Blank”</p>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>The group has 1 minute total for each person to play a phrase card that completes the I Am statement for Gerald. A card is played by placing it face down in front of Gerald.</p>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Gerald shuffles the cards to keep the identity of the person who played the card anonymous. Gerald then reads each phrase card out loud to the group.</p>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>If he wants to do so, Gerald can choose one card and ask the player of that card to reveal him/herself and explain why he/she played that card.</p>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Gerald chooses one phrase card from the pile that he most wants to be true. The person who played that card reveals him/herself, explains why they chose that card and wins a point.</p>
<h4>Step 9</h4>
<p>Gerald keeps the phrase card he chose and returns the rest of the phrase cards to the bottom of the pile.</p>
<h4>Step 10</h4>
<p>Step 10: The person sitting to Gerald’s left goes next. The goal is to get around the group at least twice.</p>
<h4>Step 11</h4>
<p>At the end of the night, each person should choose the one card that most resonates with them and take it home.</p>
