        SPARK is Crossroads’ annual summer series focusing on “IDEAS TO IGNITE YOUR LIFE.” Summer is different than the rest of the year; We find time to relax, recharge and be inspired. So get ready to hear from friends in our city and around the world, who have provocative, compelling ideas about life, faith, and knowing God – ideas that are igniting good things in their lives and have the power to ignite good things in the lives of you and your friends. These are speakers with unique experiences and powerful insights. Each weekend you won’t know what you’re going to hear, but you can be sure you will get a spark.
