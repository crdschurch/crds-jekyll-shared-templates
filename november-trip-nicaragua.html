                  <p class="lead">The year isn’t over yet. End your year with grit. With connection. With a whole new
                    story. You’ll fly over the Honduras mountains and step into the full Nicaraguan experience. You’ll
                    work alongside Amigos for Christ and get dirty making significant improvements to their village
                    life—whether digging out a trench for clean water or mixing concrete for chimneys. Mornings and
                    evenings you’ll get the chance to process your experience, share communal meals, have coffee in the
                    rancho or sing your heart out with a renewed sense of worship. Our goal is to connect you with your
                    sponsored Compassion child, but with the current political unrest we cannot guarantee that will
                    happen. Either way, it’s like nothing else on earth.</p>
                  <p class="lead">Since April of 2018, the country of Nicaragua has experienced extensive political
                    unrest, including a period of violent protests. Thankfully, over the past six months, violence has
                    significantly decreased. The majority of recent conflict has been seen at political rallies in a
                    few main cities. You may be asking, so is it even safe to go to Nicaragua? Crossroads relies
                    heavily on information and guidance from our partners that are living and working there each and
                    every day. They have communicated that roads have been clear and no violence has been seen where
                    they are located in over six months. They are able to work and live like they had before the unrest
                    started and are ready to host groups in 2019. Rest assured that Crossroads would never send people
                    to a location that we felt was unsafe, and we will not let fear guide our decisions. We are excited
                    to get back to helping our partners Amigos for Christ, and connecting our people with their
                    sponsored Compassion Children.</p>

                      risk and we don’t take that likely. Because of the recent political unrest in Nicaragua, the
                      United States government has Nicaragua listed as a travel advisory three. With this information,
                      we rely heavily on the partners who are living and working in Nicaragua every day to guide us and
                      to provide us with accurate information. They have told us that roads have been clear and no
                      violence has been seen where they are located in over six months. They are able to work and live

                    program that facilitates clean water getting into village homes, oral and physical health,
                    community education, and economic development in rural Nicaraguan communities. We jump into work
                    with Amigos every time we’re on Nicaraguan soil, because we trust and respect the way they’re
                    revitalizing villages in simple but powerful ways.</p>
