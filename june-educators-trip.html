                  <p class="lead">The breath of fresh air goes both ways. Travel with other educators on this amazing,
                    immersive trip where you’ll humbly support Nicaraguan teachers in ways they otherwise don’t get. At
                    the same time: experience the personal fulfillment of being far from home and seeing your career
                    happen through another’s eyes.</p>
                  <p class="lead">Since April of 2018, the country of Nicaragua has experienced extensive political
                    unrest, including a period of violent protests. Thankfully, over the past six months, violence has
                    significantly decreased. The majority of recent conflict has been seen at political rallies in a
                    few main cities. You may be asking, so is it even safe to go to Nicaragua? Crossroads relies
                    heavily on information and guidance from our partners that are living and working there each and
                    every day. They have communicated that roads have been clear and no violence has been seen where
                    they are located in over six months. They are able to work and live like they had before the unrest
                    started and are ready to host groups in 2019. Rest assured that Crossroads would never send people
                    to a location that we felt was unsafe, and we will not let fear guide our decisions. We are excited
                    to get back to helping our partners Rayo de Sol, and connecting our people with their sponsored
                    Compassion Children.</p>

                  <p class="font-size-small font-family-base">Traveling internationally always has some level of risk
                    and we don’t take that likely. Because of the recent political unrest in Nicaragua, the United
                    States government has Nicaragua listed as a travel advisory three. With this information, we rely
                    heavily on the partners who are living and working in Nicaragua every day to guide us and to
                    provide us with accurate information. They have told us that roads have been clear and no violence
                    has been seen where they are located in over six months. They are able to work and live like they
                    had before the unrest started and are ready to host groups in 2019. We also have multiple plans in
                    place in the event of an unforeseen situation.</p>
