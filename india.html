            aftercare facilities are designed for the rescue and restoration of girls who were trafficked as minors
            into the sex trade. The homes provide a safe haven where the girls receive physical, emotional, social and
            spiritual healing, vocational training and community, while the prosecution of perpetrators is aggressively
            pursued. <br><br>Mahima also has a home for children who are considered at great risk for being abducted
            into the trade. They recently launched an educational program to bring awareness of the dangers and

            and children at risk of trafficking reside together in homes led by second and third generation leaders,
            many whom themselves grew up in the homes. They have a school where the Apple kids can learn together with
            kids from the neighborhood and they provide educational scholarships in high risk, extremely impoverished
            rural communities to over 1,000 kids. Founded by Brazilians and run by Nepalis, Apple is the place to

            routes off the beaten path and through places which have been hardest hit by exploitation, disaster, and
            poverty. Five14 adventurers take home the beauty of the Himalayas in their hearts but leave knowing their

            square miles more than 10,000 women are forced to sell their bodies to thousands of men who visit daily.
            Many are trafficked from Bangladesh, Nepal and rural India. For others, poverty has left them without
            options. <br><br>Since 2001, Freeset has been providing a sustainable alternative form of employment for

            poor and oppressed by strengthening ventures that promote justice. India, with over 1.1 billion people, has
            a growing economy and a rich cultural history. At the same time, according to World Bank, approximately two
            thirds of Indians live with an income of less than $2 a day. Millions suffer from human trafficking and
            other extreme forms of injustice due to poverty, corruption, discrimination, and other unjust causes. JVI
            works with local partners to address these issues, bringing greater freedom, justice and restoration to the
            poor and oppressed.</p>

          Indian bread (naan and rotis--think flatbread), vegetable curries, stir fry. Vegetarian options are always
          available. Red meat is scarce. Chai tea is available everywhere you go. While everything you eat will likely
          have an Indian flare, there are many continental restaurants with foods to satisfy a more bland palate. We
          always manage to find Western Style pizza a least once!</p>
