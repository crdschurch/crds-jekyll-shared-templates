<div class="bg-gray soft">
<p class="font-size-base">Use these basics as you start convos with your family:</p>
<ol class="font-size-base crds-list"><li><strong>Be great listeners</strong>. Put your screen down and look your kids in the eye. Silence your phone. Encourage them for sharing. Watch what your face is communicating.</li>
<li><strong>Be patient</strong>. Give your kid time to respond. Silence is okay. It may take some time for them to communicate their thoughts. Give them space to process.</li>
<li><strong>Be curious</strong>. The point is to have conversations with your kids, not to answer every question listed. If they drift to another topic - go with them. Keep talking. Keep asking questions. Keep listening.</li>
