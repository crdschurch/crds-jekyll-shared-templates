            a high-contrast country with both jungle and desert, high wealth and extreme poverty, you’ll be immersed in
            Bolivian life. Get your hands dirty and heart warm. This trip centers around a community suffering hard
            from poverty but not optimism—so you’ll be part in reshaping their physical reality and experiencing the
            joy that happens with strong relationships and a good God. Plus, have the amazing chance to meet your
            sponsored Compassion child. </span></div>

            Compassion trips, we typically spend time at several Compassion churches or child centers playing or doing
            crafts with kids, encouraging the leaders, visiting nearby families’ homes, and anything else we can do to
            support the great work happening there.</span><span> We also spend time working with our local partner,
            Agua Yaku, helping to provide clean water to those lacking that vital resource. Whatever we do, we promise
            it will be meaningful.</span></span></p>

      <p class="font-size-small font-family-base">Yes! We are setting one day aside for everyone to spend time with
        their sponsored child (or children). How sweet is that? Don't worry, Compassion will also have translators on

        market, and hear God speaking to you in ways you would never expect.</p>

          <p class="white text-white font-size-base">Crossroads members Danny &amp; Vanessa Beams moved to Bolivia over
            ten years ago to go into full time ministry there. Danny established Agua Yaku with the mission of bringing
            clean water to people in some of the most remote areas of the country through well drilling, water filter
            distribution, and clean water education, all while sharing the Gospel. He regularly takes teams from all
            over North America to rural areas where they serve others, bond as a team, and share the Good News.</p>

          <p class="white text-white font-size-base">At Crossroads, we’re seriously committed to Compassion
            International and the child-advocacy work they so passionately undertake. Their work releases children from
            spiritual, economic, social, and physical poverty. The goal is for each child to become a responsible and
            fulfilled adult. Sponsoring a child is a huge part of this work, and so is visiting your child and taking
            that relationship to a whole new level.</p>
