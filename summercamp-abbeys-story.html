            <p class="lead">I remember my first time at summer camp like it was yesterday. I played in the pool for hours, worshipped with a live
            band side by side with friends, got sunburnt and lots of bug bites, I played paintball for the first time ever (and
            sucked at it), I strengthened relationships with those who were at camp with me, and I grew closer to God.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8">
            <p class="font-size-base">It was an incredible week where I pushed myself and did things I had never done before. It was the best decision I made
            that summer and has been the three summers since. From experience I can tell you, <strong>you will grow closer to God when you
            serve at HS or MSM camp this summer.</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="font-size-base">When camp leader sign-ups opened in 2016, I sat in a Crossroads auditorium and watched the video encouraging people to
            sign up to lead. I saw the Facebook post from Crossroads Student Ministry encouraging people to sign up to lead. I even
            served as a Middle School Ministry volunteer at a weekly service where, you guessed it I was “encouraged” to sign up to
            lead. But, I didn’t think I could sign up to lead for a number of reasons:
            </p>
            <p class="font-size-base">
                <ol>
                    <li>I had never been to ANY camp. That’s right, my first time at summer camp ever was the time I signed up to lead a group
                    of 7th grade girls when I was a 29 year old adult. Shouldn’t somebody who leads know things like campfire games, how to
                    check a bunk for bed bugs, how to comfort a homesick kid, or how to pee in the woods (okay, I know how to pee in the
                    woods, but not because of camping. That’s another story....). I didn’t even know what to expect at camp, how could I
                    lead students?</li><br>
                    <li>I did not feel like a worthy enough leader. Sure, I was learning about God and was growing closer to him, but I had this
                    idea that people who are worthy of leadership should be spending hours studying the Bible, should be living this perfect
                    life, and should know all the answers to the tough questions - like, did it REALLY only take 7 days to create the earth
                    or could time have been measured differently? For some reason, the potential that a student could ask me this specific
                    question scared the crap out of me! If I wasn’t leading a perfect “Christian” life with all of the answers, how could I
                    be a good example for students?
</li><br>
                    <li>I had a full-time job with Monday - Friday hours. My vacation time was precious, my job allocated 18 days a year to paid
                    time off (PTO) and I treated each day like it was gold. I even went into the office with a nasty cold one time just so I
                    wouldn’t have to take PTO. If you’ve ever done that you know people basically treat you like a leper, but that should
                    tell you how much I wouldn’t waste a PTO day. People with flexible hours, or summers off, or college students home from
                    the summer can sign up to lead, my PTO time is too precious. If I only have 18 days a year, how could I give up 5 just
                    for camp?</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p class="font-size-base"><strong>The things standing in your way of leading at camp can be overcome.</strong> Signing up as interested does not commit you to
            serving at camp, but signing up starts a conversation to learn more about camp and see if it would be a good fit for
            you.</p>
            <p class="font-size-base">There is something special about going off the grid for a few days. It’s why Crossroads does things like Man Camp, Woman
            Camp, and Couples Camp; it’s why really smart people take sabbaticals; and it’s why we all love vacation (can I get an
            amen?). The same is true for HS and MSM Camp. You might think that because students don’t have jobs, or email inboxes
            overflowing with demands, or because they are already on summer break that they don’t need the time away - you’re wrong.
            God uses this special time with students and leaders to do big things. He provides healing, comfort, and clarity to all
            who are at camp, whether than are 11 years old or 29 years old, like I was my first time. God moves at camp and I don’t
            want you to miss that. I experienced a deepening of my relationship with God each summer while I am at camp. I am so
            thankful that I said yes to MSM and HS camp.</p>
            <p class="font-size-base">Don’t get me wrong, like all good things Camp is a sacrifice. You’ll be tired. You’ll be uncomfortable at times.
            Students can be awkward. But camp is worth it. Leading students at camp will push you to a new place. <strong>You will grow
            closer to God when you serve at HS or MSM camp this summer.</strong></p>
            <p class="font-size-base">Back to those things that almost held me back in 2016,
                <ol>
                    <li>I didn’t need to know anything about camp. Crossroads staff made it easy with packing lists, game ideas, clear
                    instructions, and a well-planned camp experience that made it simple for a newbie like me to lead. They also provided me
                    with much needed training where I could ask questions and get expert advice from more experienced leaders. Whether it’s
                    your first time at camp or you’ve been many times before, you’ll be fine. And, the staff at Camp Chautaqua takes
                    excellent care of the cabins.
</li><br>
                    <li>I didn’t need to live the perfect life or have all the answers. To lead at camp, there is an interview and application
                    process because it is an immersive experience and an important role in the lives of students. But, nobody asked me about
                    the 7 days - and even if they had it’s okay to say “I don’t know, let’s look into it together.” I realized it wasn’t
                    about my bible knowledge or how well I prayed out loud. Instead, it was about my character and how well I was responding
                    to God’s voice in my life. Nobody’s perfect. We just want leaders to commit to doing their best to honor God and others
                    when leading at camp.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>It was worth giving up PTO hours. Hear me, it was worth every bit of 5 days off work - 5 days of precious time away - to
                    lead at camp. I never regretted it, not even a little bit. Not even in 2016 when I had to work the week between
                    Christmas and New Years, which was usually time I took off. I knew I had made a worthwhile sacrifice.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p class="font-size-base">Let’s talk about camp. Signing up today simply starts the conversation with your Crossroads staff partner. Scary, yes.
            Time consuming, yes. Worth it, absolutely yes! The things standing in your way of leading at camp can be overcome, God
            moves at camp, and you will grow closer to God when you serve at HS or MSM camp this summer.</p>
