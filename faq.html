<h1 style="text-align: center;">Got questions? We’ve got answers.</h1><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>When</strong> <strong>I can sign up for GO Local?</strong><br>Now! Sign ups are open until April 29th at midnight.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Does everyone sign up separately?</strong><br>If you’re serving on your own, you can sign up for yourself.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Can I serve with my family?</strong><br>You bet! Just one person needs to sign up from your family so you can serve together.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What if I want to serve with a big group of friends?</strong><br>Awesome. just make sure they all sign up individually (even if you're all joining the same group), that way there are enough supplies for everyone.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>When are projects happening?</strong><br>There are multiple time slots for May 10-13. Pick which day and time works best for you!</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What if I can't find a project in my city?</strong><br><span>We'll help! Drop us an email at <a href="mailto:golocal@crossroads.net">golocal@crossroads.net</a>.</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Do I need to bring supplies?<br></strong>Your project leader will communicate with you if there are any needs.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What do I wear?</strong><br>Definitely clothes that can get dirty (or just sweaty). Work pants and a plain white T-shirt are perfect.  Basically, don't bring your designer jeans.</p>where most people have a gazillion followers on the internet and very few meaningful relationships. You’re asking if people want to go beyond the surface level. Let them know that you’ve found something that challenges and encourages you every week, and invite them to watch with you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>I asked a bunch of people if they wanted to watch service with me, and they all said no. What do I do now?</strong> <br>Way to be bold. It’s frustrating when people don’t respond the way we want them to, but don’t give up yet. Sometimes changing the invitation helps. Try something like having a potluck dinner or a pancake breakfast at the same time you would usually watch service. No agenda, just time for people to get to know each other. Then invite them back same time, same place next week to watch service.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>How do I make worship feel less awkward without a band and a million LED lights?</strong> <br>You get to set the tone–it’s your home so you’re in charge. If you stand and sing, so will they. If you sit quietly and hope no one notices, they’ll do that, too. And best way to get comfortable with worshiping in your home is to get some reps in during the week. Using music to connect with God on your own will start to feel natural, and it will be easier to connect with him when others are around. And always remember that volume is your friend.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Our internet is crappy. Is there a way for us to avoid so much buffering?</strong><br>Yes and no. Live video is incredibly demanding on internet connections. If yours is flaky, we’d recommend watching service a week behind on Youtube. Youtube uses way WAY less bandwidth and plays nicer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Service is over. Now what?</strong><br>It’s totally your call. The key is to set expectations before you get started. People won’t say it, but they love knowing when something is over. If after service you want to do coffee (or beer), that’s great! Just state the end time clearly up front. It honors their time and yours.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>My home is really small. Are there other places you would recommend for my community to gather?</strong><br>Good things happen when you open your home and invite people in, no matter how small it is. We’ve seen communities start in both 500 square foot apartments and gigantic mansions. And meeting in a rented facility isn’t a golden ticket. Whatever space you have is enough.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Our gathering is getting too big for my house. What should I do?</strong><br>That’s an awesome problem to have! We’d love to walk you through next steps for you community. Email <a href="mailto:anywhere@crossroads.net">anywhere@crossroads.net</a>, and we’ll set up a time to talk.</p>

<hr><h4 id="q7"><a class="anchorjs-link " href="#q7" aria-label="Anchor link for: q7" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>Will there be onsite groups?</h4>
<p>Yes! You’re always welcome to join an ongoing onsite group and do the Journey with them. You can find the available onsite groups at <a href="https://www.crossroads.net/onsitegroups">crossroads.net/onsitegroups</a>.</p>

<hr><h4 id="q8"><a class="anchorjs-link " href="#q8" aria-label="Anchor link for: q8" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>What if I’m already in a group?</h4>
<p>Great! Do the journey with your current group. If your group is larger, we suggest breaking up into groups of 8-10 people for the sake of time. If you have space for additional people, we would encourage you to make your group public for others to join on the Group Tool! Or if you’ve had the itch to lead, this is the best time to start.</p>

<hr><h4 id="q9"><a class="anchorjs-link " href="#q8" aria-label="Anchor link for: q8" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>How does group time work?</h4>
<p>Your group will meet together every week for 4 weeks (starting after the weekend services on Feb 17/18). Stay on track, this journey has a big ending that you won’t want to miss. In the past, many groups have operated a week behind the weekend content. That can’t happen with this journey. Your group must complete four group meetings before the final weekend (March 17/18.) The group guide is in the app, along with the individual work. Have your individual work completed prior to going to group (it will take about an hour to complete). Everyone will use their own device in group time, so be sure to bring yours. For an even better group experience, you can put the group guide (in the app) on Apple TV or Chromecast.</p>

<hr><h4 id="q10"><a class="anchorjs-link " href="#q9" aria-label="Anchor link for: q9" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>How long does it take to get through the group and individual content?</h4>
<p>The group discussion will take about an hour. If you have a larger group, or your group is extra chatty, it may take up to 90 minutes. The individual work will take no more than an hour per week.</p>

<hr><h4 id="q11"><a class="anchorjs-link " href="#q9" aria-label="Anchor link for: q9" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>If I miss a weekend service during the series, can I still participate?</h4>
<p>Sure! Our weekend messages are posted online at <a href="https://www.crossroads.net/live">crossroads.net/live</a> and in the Crossroads app, so you can catch up if you have to miss. The weekend experience is a large component of the journey, but it is just one of three important components. The weekend message, individual work, and group materials are all integrated so you’ll have the best experience participating in all of them. Remember that you can catch services even when you’re out of town by Streaming Live through the Crossroads app or <a href="https://www.crossroads.net/live">crossroads.net/live</a>.</p>
