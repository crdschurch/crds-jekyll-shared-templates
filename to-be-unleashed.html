            <p class="lead"><strong>To be unleashed</strong>—to free from a leash; to let loose; to throw, shoot, or set in motion forcefully—I first had to ask
            myself, “Wait, am I on a leash? Am I tied or bound to something?” The answer many times in my life has been yes.</p>
            <p class="font-size-base">I remember the first time I truly acknowledged this. I was about 28 years old. I was having a meeting with my boss at
            the time and he was asking me to meet with a group of women. I worked at a church, this request sounds pretty simple,
            right? Nope. I looked at him and said, “No way. Those women won’t want to meet with me, what do I have to offer them?
            Nope, not going to do it.” He looked me in the eye and asked, “Why?” And not just a simple why—he wanted me to explain
            the real why. I tried listing the simple stuff that, in my mind, anyone could see. They were all pretty, well dressed,
            like REAL ladies. They had their stuff together. They all had money. What did I have to offer them? Just to be clear, I
            didn’t know these ladies very well. They had all been super kind to me whenever we interacted, but I made judgments
            about them based on some rules I had formed in my head about myself and other women from way earlier in life. Being with
            groups of women was my own personal hell.</p>
            <p class="font-size-base crds-list">
                <strong>Let me list all the things I told him:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>I was in the psych ward in high school because I attempted suicide three times—so I was emotionally unstable (at least
                    that’s what I thought about myself).</li>
                    <li>I could have wrote a biography called “The Road to Hoedom” describing my life before marriage.</li>
                    <li>I didn’t finish college.</li>
                    <li>I got married at 20 and had my first kid before 21.</li>
                    <li>I was always broke and didn’t see that ever changing.</li>
                    <li>I NEVER fit in with women. I wanted to wear gym shoes and workout clothes all the time and I didn’t understand the small
                    talk.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p class="font-size-base">The list could go on and on. It was super uncomfortable admitting all of this to him, but then he just looked at me—like
            really looked at me—in a way that made me feel unable to hide, and he challenged me. He reminded me who God says I am. I
            am a daughter of the God, created in His image, forgiven and loved. My list wasn’t my identity, it was just part of my
            story or beliefs I had because of brokeness.</p>
            <p class="font-size-base">I was letting this list of all my failures and brokenness leash me to a lie. The lie was that my identity was the sum of
            all my failures, rather than who God says I am. I had been missing out on experiencing God’s redemptive power in all
            these things because I held onto them, wrapped them around my neck like a collar, and attached it to a short leash. I
            could only go so far, do so much, say so much before the leash pulled me back to my reality of who I was; a failure, a
            slut, uneducated, financially needy, and emotionally unstable woman.</p>
            <p class="font-size-base">My boss had me write down my story, all the things I identified myself as, and then I had to read it out loud to a group
            of people who loved me. I read it, cried, wept, felt ashamed, then I burned that letter. As soon as I burned that letter
            those people who loved me began telling me who I really was. They spoke words over me about my identity in Christ, who
            He says I am. They told me how they received me and the strengths and giftings they see in me. It was a life changing
            moment. When I burned that paper of all my “failures and brokenness,” it was like God was helping me unhook the leash I
            had around my neck. Then, when my community spoke truth and encouragement over me, I knew I was being unleashed. Not
            just unhooked from a leash, but unleashed—like propelling me, a broken but beautiful daughter, into the world with my
            true identity.</p>
            <p class="font-size-base">Fast forward sixteen years (there are lots of other God moments and growth in there, but this is a blog post, not a
            book), my current day job is building into groups of women. God has brought me full circle. Me, that same woman with the
            list of all the reasons why I didn’t measure up, the one who said my personal hell was to be in groups of women, the one
            who walked in shame because of all my failures, spends my days pursuing “unleashing” moments for other women. God has
            redeemed all of it, every single thing I wrote on that paper and burned, He has redeemed.</p>
