This all-Oakley trip is a great way to experience a new culture while also growing closer to your community from home. You’ll fly over the Honduras mountains and step into the full Nicaraguan experience. You’ll work with your neighbors alongside Amigos for Christ and get dirty making significant improvements to their village life—whether digging out a trench for clean water or mixing concrete for chimneys. Mornings and evenings you’ll get the chance to process your experience, share communal meals, have coffee in the rancho or sing your heart out with a renewed sense of worship. Our goal is to connect you with your sponsored Compassion child, but with the current political unrest we cannot guarantee that will happen. Either way, it’s like nothing else on earth.</span></p>
                                    <p class="lead">Since April of 2018, the country of Nicaragua has experienced extensive political unrest, including a period of violent protests. Thankfully, over the past six months, violence has significantly decreased. The majority
                                        of recent conflict has been seen at political rallies in a few main cities. You may be asking, so is it even safe to go to Nicaragua? Crossroads relies heavily on information and guidance from our partners that
                                        are living and working there each and every day. They have communicated that roads have been clear and no violence has been seen where they are located in over six months. They are able to work and live like they
                                        had before the unrest started and are ready to host groups in 2019. Rest assured that Crossroads would never send people to a location that we felt was unsafe, and we will not let fear guide our decisions. We are
                                        excited to get back to helping our partners Amigos for Christ, and connecting our people with their sponsored Compassion Children.</p>
