<p style="background-color: #e2e2e2; padding: 30px;"><strong>When we get closer to Woman Camp, you’ll get an email from your Campsite Host</strong>. <br>Campsite Hosts bring their assigned group of 6-8 women together one time before Woman Camp to meet, make plans for sharing supplies, answer questions, and build camaraderie for the adventure ahead! Your Campsite Host is your point of contact for all things Woman Camp. She'll contact the Woman Camp Lead Team if you have questions she can't answer. And remember, we've got <a href="/womancamp/faqs/">these FAQs</a>! </p>
<h3><strong>What to Pack</strong></h3>
<p>Here’s a list of what you need (and don’t need) to pack. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Borrowing gear will be your best friend</span>. No need to buy a bunch of new stuff. And pack like you have no one to impress. You really don’t. </p>
<p><strong>One Backpack + One Duffel<br></strong>Fit everything into one backpack and one duffel. You'll be walking with all your gear for ONE MILE on a hilly dirt road, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">so please pack very lightly.</span> </p>
<p><strong>Clothing<br></strong>Two main suggestions: You want to stay dry and warm, so dress in layers. Bring <span style="text-decoration: underline;">extra wool socks</span>, a warm jacket for night, and a rain layer. Bring comfortable, closed-toe shoes good for the woods. Water-resistant if possible. Rubber boots or shoes are a big bonus.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Toiletries</strong><br>Wet Wipes are great to have along. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razors, makeup and beauty products are all optional. We’ll have port-a-lets, but no sinks or running water. </p>
<p><strong>Individual Camping Gear<br></strong>Every camper needs these things.</p>
<ul><li>One breakfast, one lunch, plenty of snacks and drinks. (Food ideas below.)</li>
<li>Headlamp or flashlight—cheap is fine!</li>
<li>Folding, lightweight camp chair</li>
<li>Sleeping bag (Cold-weather rated is best, if you have access to one.)</li>
<li>Blanket</li>
<li>Pad to go under your sleeping bag. Yoga mats work, too.</li>
<li>Water bottle. We’ll have water tanks for refills.</li>
<li>Travel coffee cup and coffee/tea supplies: something to boil water, instant coffee, creamer packets, etc.</li>
<li>Earplugs (definitely will help you sleep better)</li>
<li>Pen</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">White</span> plate, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">white</span> cloth napkin, metal fork and knife, and drinking glass (for dinner feast)</li>
<li>Work/garden gloves </li>
</ul><p><strong>Group Camping Gear</strong><br>These are things not everyone needs to bring individually. Plan for who’s bringing what in your pre-camp meeting with your Campsite Host.</p>
<ul><li>Tents with <a href="http://hiking.about.com/od/Hiking-Glossary/g/Whats-A-Rainfly.htm">rain fly</a>s, even if no rain predicted.</li>
<li>Plastic tarp/sheet to put under tent, even if no rain predicted. (Cheap is fine!)</li>
<li>Lighter or fire-starter</li>
<li>1 large trash bag</li>
</ul><h3><strong>What NOT to Bring</strong></h3>
<ul><li>Anything that requires electricity (exception: breast pumps for nursing moms, since we'll have a hook-up)</li>
<li>Cell phones! Truly, no cell phones. You can leave them in your cars. </li>
<li>Heavy gear or supplies. Everyone walks a mile over gravel. </li>
</ul><h3><strong>Food Detail</strong></h3>
<p>We’ll provide dinner and dessert on Saturday night—wine and non-alcoholic option included. Beyond that, you’ll need to bring your own food for lunch on Saturday, breakfast on Sunday and snacks for all the in-between times. If you have food allergies, please plan accordingly with some extras. Bring food that can be stored without refrigeration. Energy bars, jerky, cheese and crackers, nuts, bars, fruit snacks, granola, dried fruit, freeze dried foods, "Mountain House" meals...are all great options. Have fun with it!</p>

<h3><strong>Camping 101</strong></h3>
<ul><li>Moisture is the enemy of comfort. Keep that in mind as you make choices. What gets wet, stays wet. Synthetic is better than cotton. Wool is fantastic.</li>
<li>Wear good, water-resistant shoes.</li>
<li>Do not place your tents or camping chairs too close to the fire, especially when you walk away! Sparks can reach tents, but heat cannot. And sparks can ruin a tent or start a wildfire quickly.</li>
<li>Always stake the tent down, even if it's not windy.</li>
<li>Always put on the rainfly securely, even if it doesn’t look like rain.</li>
<li>Always keep the doors zipped shut unless you are actively accessing the tent. You don’t want to sleep with critters and bugs.</li>
<li>Always place your tent on the most level ground you can find. The ground will not be level so place the “head” of your bedroll at the highest point.</li>
<li>Locate your headlamp and have it with you before dark. Keep it around your neck for easiest access.</li>
<li>Make sure that anything you bring (clothes, gear, etc) is as versatile and multi-functional as possible. It is much better to bring 5 things than 25 things.</li>
<li>Put all trash into a trash bag immediately. Things will blow around and get scattered very quickly.</li>
<li>If you go to bed first, put in your earplugs. Tents do not block sound. The rest of your group should not be expected to get super quiet since you chose to call it a night.</li>
