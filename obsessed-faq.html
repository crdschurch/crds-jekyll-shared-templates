<hr><h4 id="q2"><a class="anchorjs-link " href="#q2" aria-label="Anchor link for: q2" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>What’s the Journey?</h4>
<p>The Journey is a five-week self-discovery process. Thousands of people (kids and adults) come together to focus on a topic to kick-start spiritual growth. It’s comprised of three components: the weekend service, individual challenges in the app and a group discussion.</p>
<p class="small"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<hr><h4 id="q3"><a class="anchorjs-link " href="#q3" aria-label="Anchor link for: q3" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>I’m sorting out the whole God thing. Can I participate?</h4>
<p>Absolutely. We welcome people from all different places of their spiritual journey. You will be asked to read from the Bible and complete some individual challenges, but your questions are welcomed and expected.</p>

<hr><h4 id="q5"><a class="anchorjs-link " href="#q5" aria-label="Anchor link for: q5" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>How can I get into a group?</h4>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.crossroads.net/OBSESSED">crossroads.net/OBSESSED</a> to get connected to a group through the Group Tool.  The Group Tool will enable you to filter by the kind of group you’re looking for and the area of town where you’d like to meet.</p>

<hr><h4 id="q5b"><a class="anchorjs-link " href="#q5" aria-label="Anchor link for: q5" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>When should my journey group start?</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Your group will meet together every week for 4 weeks (starting after the weekend services on Feb 17/18). Stay on track, this journey has a big ending that you won’t want to miss. In the past, many groups have operated a week behind the weekend content. That can’t happen with this journey. Your group must complete four group meetings before the final weekend (March 17/18.)   The group guide is in the app, along with the individual work. Have your individual work completed prior to going to group (it will take about an hour to complete). Everyone will use their own device in group time, so be sure to bring yours. For an even better group experience, you can put the group guide (in the app) </span><span>on Apple TV or Chromecast.</span></p>

<hr><h4 id="q6"><a class="anchorjs-link " href="#q6" aria-label="Anchor link for: q6" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>I can’t find a group that works for me.</h4>
<p>If you haven’t found a group in the Group Tool that works for you, you can always join an onsite group. Or, if you prefer to join a group that meets online, you can filter by “online groups” in the Group Tool.</p>

<hr><h4 id="q7"><a class="anchorjs-link " href="#q7" aria-label="Anchor link for: q7" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>Will there be onsite groups?</h4>
<p>Yes! You’re always welcome to join an ongoing onsite group and do the Journey with them. You can find the available onsite groups at <a href="https://www.crossroads.net/onsitegroups">crossroads.net/onsitegroups</a>.</p>

<hr><h4 id="q8"><a class="anchorjs-link " href="#q8" aria-label="Anchor link for: q8" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>What if I’m already in a group?</h4>
<p>Great! Do the journey with your current group. If your group is larger, we suggest breaking up into groups of 8-10 people for the sake of time. If you have space for additional people, we would encourage you to make your group public for others to join on the Group Tool! Or if you’ve had the itch to lead, this is the best time to start.</p>

<hr><h4 id="q9"><a class="anchorjs-link " href="#q8" aria-label="Anchor link for: q8" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>How does group time work?</h4>
<p>Your group will meet together every week for 4 weeks (starting after the weekend services on Feb 17/18). Stay on track, this journey has a big ending that you won’t want to miss. In the past, many groups have operated a week behind the weekend content. That can’t happen with this journey. Your group must complete four group meetings before the final weekend (March 17/18.)

<hr><h4 id="q10"><a class="anchorjs-link " href="#q9" aria-label="Anchor link for: q9" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>How long does it take to get through the group and individual content?</h4>
<p>The group discussion will take about an hour. If you have a larger group, or your group is extra chatty, it may take up to 90 minutes. The individual work will take no more than an hour per week.</p>
<p class="small"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<hr><h4 id="q11"><a class="anchorjs-link " href="#q9" aria-label="Anchor link for: q9" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>If I miss a weekend service during the series, can I still participate?</h4>
<p>Sure! Our weekend messages are posted online at <a href="https://www.crossroads.net/live">crossroads.net/live</a> and in the Crossroads app, so you can catch up if you have to miss. The weekend experience is a large component of the journey, but it is just one of three important components. The weekend message, individual work, and group materials are all integrated so you’ll have the best experience participating in all of them. Remember that you can catch services even when you’re out of town by Streaming Live through the Crossroads app or <a href="https://www.crossroads.net/live">crossroads.net/live</a>.</p>

<p>Of course. Just let your group leader know in advance when you won’t be able to attend.</p>

<hr><h4 id="q13"><a class="anchorjs-link " href="#q11" aria-label="Anchor link for: q11" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>How do I lead a group?</h4>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-22a767ab-70ac-df2c-abb3-aa4d011a79ea"><span>If you’re interested in leading a group, go to </span><a href="https://www.crossroads.net/obsessed"><span>crossroads.net/obsessed</span></a><span>, click lead a group and create your group in the Group Tool. You’ll see it already designated as a "Journey" group, but mark it as public for people to be able to search and join it. There will be a group leader packet to pick up on weekend 1 - February 17/18.</span></span></p>
