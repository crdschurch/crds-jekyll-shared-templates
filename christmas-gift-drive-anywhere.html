<p class="lead">This big thing we've done around Christmas, getting gifts to children whose parents are in prison, has been known as Angel Tree. Well, this year we're growing to serve people in communities who we'll serve throughout the year and not just at Christmas. That means deeper relationship and that's what God calls us to. <strong>We're going bigger and we've changed the name to Christmas Gift Drive.</strong> We'll continue delivering gifts to children whose parents are in prison but we'll also get gifts to children who are in hospitals, gifts that will be given during Christmas events in prisons where parents and children will be reunited, gifts to families in homeless shelters, gloves/coats/socks to people in need and so much more. We're partnering with organizations all over to serve those in need.</p>
<p class="font-size-base"><strong>How can you help?</strong><br>While we know you can't be at one of the physical Crossroads sites, that doesn't mean you can't participate in Christmas Gift Drive. Quite the opposite. We are counting on you to show up for your community and serve love to those in need. Here are three options for you:</p>
<p class="font-size-base">1. <strong>Partner with one of these organizations:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.prisonfellowship.org/about/angel-tree/">Project Angel Tree</a>: </strong>Angel Tree provides toys to children of prison inmates. If you walk in your local mall or box store during the holiday season, you'll likely see an angel tree, which is a tree-shaped display with the names of local children, families, or individuals with special needs who could use a helping hand. Shoppers can choose a name from the tree and provide the things the person needs. The Salvation Army, as well as many other charitable organizations, organize Angel Trees at Christmas.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.toysfortots.org/request_toys/Default.aspx">Toys for Tots</a>: </strong> Local Toys for Tots Campaigns are the heart and soul of the Marine Toys for Tots Program managed by dedicated United States Marines and local volunteers. Your Local Campaign is the best source of Toys for Tots information on how to give and receive support in your community. </li>
</ul><p class="font-size-base">2. Take a look around your city and <strong>find a local church</strong> participating in something similar and jump in with them. </p>
<p class="font-size-base">3. <strong>Help send a child in the Crossroads Community to Summer Camp: </strong>Each year, vulnerable kids in our community, specifically in the Whiz Kids program, miss out on the chance to go to camp due to funding. Not anymore because of people like you.</p>
