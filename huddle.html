        <h3 class="component-header" style="line-height: .9em;">Leading a Group already?<br />Here’s how huddle fits in.</h3>
        <p class="font-size-base">Think of huddle as a leadership development tool within Groups. Leaders can use huddle a couple of ways.</p>
        <p class="font-size-base">1. You have a group of people who are following and could move towards producing. <em>Invite them all to do huddle</em>. </p>
        <p class="font-size-base">2. As your group grows, identify those who are furthest along (i.e. following). <em>Invite the 4-6 that you want to invest in as future leaders into huddle</em>.</p>
        <p class="font-size-base">Instead of huddle being a different thing altogether, it’s how you integrate discipleship in your group, multiplying mature leaders to lead more groups who’ll do the same.</p>
