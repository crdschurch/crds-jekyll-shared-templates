<h3>Sponsor a Crossroads Compassion Child</h3>
<p class="lead" style="color: #333;">Over the past few years, Crossroads has partnered with Compassion International to sponsor thousands of kids in Nicaragua and Bolivia. Hundreds have traveled to both countries, built relationships with their sponsors, served alongside our new friends and encountered God.</p>

<p><strong>How much is it to sponsor a child?</strong><br><strong>$38 per month.</strong> This is done via credit card. All financial transactions are run through Compassion. Crossroads does not set the cost, touch the money, nor handle the credit card information. All funds go directly to Compassion International to support the child. For more information, visit <a href="http://compassion.com/">compassion.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I would like to visit my sponsored child in Bolivia or Nicaragua. Will there be an opportunity to do that?</strong><br>Yes! There are ongoing trips to Bolivia and Nicaragua to visit sponsored children. Specific dates and signup guidelines are available at <a href="http://crossroadsgo.net/find-a-trip/" target="_blank">CrossroadsGo.net</a>. Participants must sponsor a child to go on a GO Bolivia or GO Nicaragua trip. The trips are family friendly with the minimum age of participants being 10 years of age. Leadership opportunities for GO Trips are available to previous trip participants.</p>

<p><strong>I have a problem with the sponsorship that I filled out at services on March 2015 (credit card, address, etc.)</strong><br>All issues with sponsorships need to be taken up with Compassion International through the "contact us" function at <a href="http://compassion.com/">compassion.com</a> or by calling 800-336-7676. Crossroads has no possession of sponsorship forms that were filled out and unfortunately cannot help in any way.</p>
<p><strong>I already sponsor a child through Compassion International in another country, does that count as part of the Crossroads initiative?</strong><br>First, thank you so much. You are changing that child’s life! Our Crossroads initiative is in Nicaragua, so, unfortunately, children outside of Nicaragua do not count as part of this effort. That being said, please do not drop a previously sponsored child in another country to sponsor a “Crossroads’ child.” This is about changing the lives of kids in poverty, not reaching a big number. Your sponsored child is counting on you. Please remain as someone they can rely upon.</p>
<p><strong>Can I connect that child to the “Crossroads group”?</strong><br>Yes. Drop us a line at <a href="mailto:updates@crossroads.net">updates@crossroads.net</a> and we’ll get that process underway.</p>
